This application allows users to choose different conversion sections and instantly calculate measurement units when data is entered into each text field.  It uses UserDefaults for data persistence. User's interaction is stored when the app leaves the foreground and reloaded when it regains focus. The current project is still under development, and the current stage is mainly to test the correctness of the conversion and the integrity of the interface. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
